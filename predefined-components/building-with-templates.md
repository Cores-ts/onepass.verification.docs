# Building with templates

OnePass offers pre-defined templates and resources that can be used as building blocks to create custom verification types and levels. This approach provides flexibility and enables organizations to tailor the verification process to their specific needs.

By combining pre-defined templates, you can create a custom verification process that fits your organization's unique requirements. This could involve using existing templates as a starting point and modifying them to suit your needs, or building entirely new templates from scratch.

OnePass offers a variety of verification checks and entities that can be used to build custom templates. These checks and entities can be easily modified or combined in different ways to create new templates.

Using templates can help streamline the verification process by providing a consistent and standardized approach to verification. By using pre-defined templates, you can ensure that the verification process is consistent across different parts of your organization, which can help reduce errors and improve efficiency.

Three types of pre-defined components are available:

1. **Entities**: Represent individual objects, such as people or organizations, with specific attributes and relationships with other entities.
2. **Verification Types**: Define various verification methods, such as document verification or background checks.
3. **Verification Level Templates**: Combine multiple verification types to create a comprehensive verification process for specific use cases.
